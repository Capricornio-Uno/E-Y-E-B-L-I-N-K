It's the year 2050. After the climate breakdown, life on the surface of the planet
became impossible ... Humans and cyborgs started to live in subterranean megacities where 
everyone struggles to survive. 

In this wicked world, you're a little girl called Valeria. You survive collecting and selling
junk, hacking machines and stealing Qtrits, the cryptocurrency that wealthy people uses in
the underground.
